# Assembly Guide for SVAIS Project

## Introduction
This assembly guide provides detailed instructions for assembling the SVAIS (Smart Voice-based Acoustic Intelligent System) hardware components. Follow the steps carefully to ensure proper assembly and functionality of the system.

## Required Tools and Materials
- Soldering iron and solder
- Wire cutters and strippers
- Multimeter for testing
- Tweezers for handling small components
- Heat shrink tubing (optional)
- Screwdriver set for enclosure assembly

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Breadboard Testing
Before soldering components, it is recommended to perform breadboard testing to verify the circuit functionality.
- Assemble the circuit on a breadboard according to the provided connection diagram.
- Test each module (microphone, amplifier, ESP32) individually to ensure they work as expected.
- Measure voltage levels at critical points (5V, 3.3V) using a multimeter.

### 2. Soldering Components
Once breadboard testing is successful, proceed to solder the components onto the PCB.
- Start with the smallest components (resistors, capacitors) and work your way up to larger components (headers, connectors).
- Ensure proper orientation of polarized components (e.g., diodes, capacitors).
- Use a soldering iron to heat the pad and lead simultaneously, then apply solder to create a solid joint.

### 3. Power Supply Connections
- Connect the UPS module to the PCB, ensuring the input and output connections are correct.
- Solder the LiPo battery connector to the designated pads on the PCB.
- Verify the power path using a multimeter to ensure proper voltage levels.

### 4. Microphone and Speaker Assembly
- Solder the MAX4466 microphone module to the designated input pins on the main board.
- Connect the PAM8403 speaker amplifier to the DAC GPIO pins on the ESP32.
- Ensure the microphone is positioned away from the speaker to minimize feedback.

### 5. Final Assembly
- Place the assembled PCB into the enclosure, ensuring all connectors align with the cutouts.
- Secure the PCB using screws or standoffs as necessary.
- Attach the enclosure cover and secure it with screws.

### 6. Testing the Assembled System
- Power on the system and check for any visual indicators (LEDs) to confirm operation.
- Test the microphone and speaker functionality by generating sound events (e.g., claps) and observing the system's response.
- Use a multimeter to check voltage levels at various points to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

## Troubleshooting
- If the system does not power on, check all connections and solder joints.
- If the microphone does not detect sound, verify the microphone connections and test with a known good microphone.
- For issues with the speaker output, check the amplifier connections and ensure the ESP32 is configured correctly.

## Conclusion
Following this assembly guide will help ensure a successful build of the SVAIS project. Document any issues encountered during assembly and testing for future reference and improvements.
