# üìä Accuracy Report for SVAIS Project

## üìù Overview

This document summarizes the detection logic and observations from the experiments conducted in the **SVAIS (Smart Voice-based Acoustic Intelligent System)** project. The focus of these experiments is on sound event detection, specifically targeting the identification of clap sounds using low-cost hardware.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detection Logic

The detection logic follows these key steps:

1.  **Audio Signal Acquisition**: Audio signals are captured using the ESP32 and MAX4466 microphone.
2.  **Feature Extraction**: Key features such as `RMS` (Root Mean Square), `ZCR` (Zero-Crossing Rate), and `spectral centroid` are extracted from the audio signals.
3.  **Thresholding**: A threshold is set for each feature to determine the presence of a clap sound.
4.  **Classification**: Based on the extracted features and their thresholds, audio segments are classified as either "clap" or "non-clap".

### Round 1: Quiet Environment

| Metric         | Details                                                 |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Environment**  | Quiet Room                                              |
| **Test Samples** | ‚Ä¢ 50 Claps<br>‚Ä¢ 50 Non-Clap Sounds (taps, speech, noise) |
| **üéØ Accuracy**  | **85%**                                                 |
| **Observations** | > The system performed well in a controlled environment. False positives were observed with certain non-clap sounds that had similar acoustic features. |

### Round 2: Noisy Environment

| Metric         | Details                                                 |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Environment**  | Noisy Room                                              |
| **Test Samples** | ‚Ä¢ 50 Claps<br>‚Ä¢ 50 Non-Clap Sounds (taps, speech, noise) |
| **üìâ Accuracy**  | **70%**                                                 |
| **Observations** | > Accuracy dropped significantly. Background noise interfered with the detection logic, leading to increased false negatives. |
