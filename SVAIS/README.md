# SVAIS (Smart Voice-based Acoustic Intelligent System)

## Overview
SVAIS is a research-focused project aimed at implementing audio signal processing and sound event detection using low-cost hardware, specifically the ESP32 combined with the MAX4466 microphone. The project begins with the detection of basic sound events, such as claps, and emphasizes a fundamentals-first approach to learning and development.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind SVAIS is to foster a deep understanding of audio signal processing techniques without relying heavily on external libraries or high-level machine learning frameworks. By focusing on the core principles of audio analysis, we aim to create a transparent and educational experience for researchers and developers alike.

## Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather original audio recordings from various sources, including the ESP32 and PC microphones.
2. **Processing**: Clean, normalize, and segment the audio files for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Implement custom algorithms to extract relevant features from the audio signals.
4. **Logic Testing**: Develop and test detection logic based on the extracted features.
5. **Iteration**: Continuously refine the methods based on experimental results and insights.

## Contribution
Contributions to the SVAIS project are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:
- Document your hypotheses, experiments, and results.
- Ensure that your code is modular and well-commented.
- Match WAV filenames with logs for easy traceability.
- Submit pull requests for any enhancements or bug fixes.

## Tools Used
- **Praat**: For audio analysis and feature extraction.
- **Sonic Visualizer**: For visualizing audio features.
- **Audacity**: For audio editing and processing.
- **Arduino IDE**: For developing and uploading code to the ESP32.
- **Python**: For offline analysis and feature extraction.

## Future Directions
Future work may include:
- Expanding the range of detectable sound events.
- Implementing more advanced signal processing techniques.
- Exploring machine learning approaches with manually extracted features.
- Enhancing documentation and educational resources for users.

Thank you for your interest in SVAIS! We hope this project serves as a valuable resource for learning and experimentation in audio signal processing.
